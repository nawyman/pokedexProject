# pokedexProject
This is a fully functional Pokedex that shows you stats and entries for any of the 1025 Pokemon

It takes any Pokemon's name and shows you an image, the stats, and a graph of where that Pokemon falls in it's generation stat-wise

I hope you enjoy and have fun with my Pokedex!!

** I don't own the right to anything Pokemon related and did this just for fun (I'm not sure if I have to say this, but here it is anyways) **
